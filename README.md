# ValeoHackathonProject
My first Hackathon!


This is my first hackathon project and we have developed an Android Application using Kotlin in which it 
first recognizes the speech and convert it into String which in background checks with the Look Up Table 
and if the the speech recognized String matches with the look up table then it goes to another activity where it 
connects with already paired phones using bluetooth around your vicinity and transfers that string to the receiver
who is waiting to receive it.

We have used Adobe XD for UI design
